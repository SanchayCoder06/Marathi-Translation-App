# बोला मराठी (Bola Marathi) — Comprehensive End-to-End Development Guide

Welcome to the official technical documentation and development guide for **बोला मराठी** (Speak Marathi)! This guide is designed to help you understand, explain, and present the project architecture, features, and end-to-end technologies utilized.

## 1. High-Level Architecture & Tech Stack

The application is built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** using a clean, modern, and zero-dependency Single Page Application (SPA) architecture. It requires no complex build tools (Webpack, Vite, etc.) or node dependencies, running entirely within the client's browser.

## 2. Core Modules & Technological Implementation

### A. The Front-End Shell & PWA Support
* **Responsive HTML5 SPA**: `index.html` defines the viewport and loads dependencies sequentially. The screen transition engine dynamically swaps view hierarchies in the `#app` container with smooth fade-in animations.
* **PWA Manifest (`manifest.json`)**: Configured for standalone, app-like display (`display: standalone`) with a dark primary theme color (`#0a0a1a`). It defines icons, enabling native system installation on desktop systems (Chrome/Edge app) and mobile home screens.
* **Service Worker Caching (`sw.js`)**: Employs an **Offline-First caching strategy** using the `CacheStorage` API. Static assets (CSS, JS, fonts, curriculum JSON) are cached locally under the name `bola-marathi-v4`. This allows the core lesson structure, video screens, translator views, and local speech synthesis to run without internet connectivity.

### B. Text-to-Speech (TTS) Engine (`js/audio.js`)
* **Web Speech API**: Uses `window.speechSynthesis` to convert written Marathi text to audio output dynamically.
* **Localization**: Programmatically queries the system voice list, prioritizing `mr-IN` (Marathi - India) voices.
* **Interactive Playback Speed**: Implements rate control so users can select:
  * **0.6x (Turtle Speed 🐢)**: For detailed listening of complex vowels.
  * **1.0x (Normal Speed ▶️)**: Standard conversational speech.
  * **1.2x (Fast Speed ⚡)**: Conversational speed practice.

### C. Speech-to-Text & Recording Engine (`js/audio.js`)
* **Native Recognition**: In Chrome/Android browsers, uses `webkitSpeechRecognition` configured for `mr-IN` to transcribe spoken Marathi directly in the browser.
* **Cross-Browser Audio Fallback**: For browsers lacking native Marathi speech recognition (like Safari/iOS), the engine records raw audio using the **MediaRecorder API** to capture a `.webm`/`.wav` blob. The file is converted to a base64 data string and dispatched to the Gemini API for cloud transcription.
* **Audio Visualizer**: Utilizing the **Web Audio API**, the app instantiates an `AudioContext`, attaches a `MediaStreamAudioSourceNode` from the microphone, and queries an `AnalyserNode` to draw a real-time pulsing audio wave.

### D. Gemini AI Pronunciation & Translation Engines (`js/ai-feedback.js`)
* **Gemini API model (`gemini-1.5-flash`)**: Chosen for low-latency responses, deep Marathi language comprehension, and robust support for Structured Output Schemas.
* **Speech Assessment Prompts**: Sends the expected Marathi phrase, user transcription/audio, and lesson metadata. It instructs Gemini to assess the speech and return a structured JSON response matching the following schema:
  ```json
  {
    "score": 88,
    "accuracy": "good",
    "feedback": "Your pronunciation of 'नमस्कार' was excellent, but try to enunciate 'कसे' slightly more clearly.",
    "wordScores": [
      { "word": "नमस्कार", "score": 95, "transliteration": "namaskar" },
      { "word": "तुम्ही", "score": 85, "transliteration": "tumhi" },
      { "word": "कसे", "score": 75, "transliteration": "kase", "tip": "Stress the 'ka' syllable." }
    ],
    "encouragement": "तुम्ही खूप छान शिकत आहात! 🌟"
  }
  ```
* **AI Translator**: Employs the same model to perform bi-directional translation (English ➔ Marathi, Marathi ➔ English, Hindi ➔ Marathi, Marathi ➔ Hindi). It outputs the translated text along with a Latin phonetic transliteration guide to help users pronounce the output.

### E. Gamified Progress Tracking (`js/progress.js`)
* **LocalStorage Persistence**: Stores user statistics locally in browser storage, removing the need for a backend database.
* **Game Elements**:
  * **Streak Tracker**: Computes consecutive daily study sessions.
  * **Experience Points (XP)**: Earned dynamically based on pronunciation scores (e.g. +15 XP for scores ≥ 90).
  * **Spaced Repetition Review**: Flags phrases with scores below 70% as "review items," prompting users to practice difficult pronunciations.

## 3. Visual Layouts & Custom CSS Styling

* **Theme**: Premium glassmorphic dark mode (`background: #0a0a1a`) with linear gradients (Indigo/Violet theme).
* **Double Circular Charts (Dashboard)**: Uses SVG vectors to render:
  1. **Daily Target Progress Ring**: Displays study minutes logged today relative to a 15-minute target.
  2. **Course Completion Ring**: Computes overall lesson completion (`completed_lessons / 100`) and updates its stroke offsets dynamically.
  Both rings are placed side-by-side inside a responsive flexbox container (`.progress-rings-container`).
* **Weekly activity chart**: Renders a vertical bar chart dynamically using pure HTML/CSS flexbox. Bar heights are calculated relative to the maximum active minutes and show exact durations using hover tooltips.
* **Stats Grid**: A 2x2 grid displaying user statistics (Streak, XP, Total Lessons, Total Study Time).
* **Bottom Navigation Bar**: A glassmorphic navigation bar pinned to the bottom of the screen with smooth transitions, managing routing for **Lessons**, **Translate**, **Videos**, and **Dashboard**.

## 4. Video Lessons Library

* **12-Module Video Course**: Embeds educational YouTube videos mapped directly to each of the 12 curriculum modules.
* **Responsive Iframe Container**: Styled with a 16:9 CSS aspect ratio box (`padding-top: 56.25%`), ensuring videos adjust perfectly to any screen size without layout shifting.
